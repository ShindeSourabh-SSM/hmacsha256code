# HMAC-SHA256 Implementation in Spring Boot

This repository contains a Spring Boot-based implementation of the HMAC (Hash-Based Message Authentication Code) algorithm using the SHA-256 hashing function. 

## Features
- Generates HMAC-SHA256 for a given input string and secret key.
- RESTful API endpoints for generating HMAC values.
- Tested using Postman for ease of verification.

## Prerequisites
- Java 17 or higher
- Maven 3.8+ 
- Postman (for API testing)

## Getting Started
### Screenshot of output that tested on postman

# Validate HMAC - Result shown "True"

# Provide wrong HMAC to Validate - Result occurs "FALSE"

Coded to test the working of HMAC - SHA256

Thank You!
